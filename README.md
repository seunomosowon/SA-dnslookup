## INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

### Hardware and software requirements

#### Hardware requirements

SA-dnslookup supports the following server platforms in the versions supported by Splunk Enterprise:

- Linux
- Windows

The app was developed to be platform agnostic, but tests are mostly run on unix.
Please contact the developer with issues running this on Windows.

#### Software requirements

To function properly, SA-dnslookup has no external requirements but needs to be installed on a full Splunk install
which provides python3.


#### Splunk Enterprise system requirements

Because this add-on runs on Splunk Enterprise, all of the [Splunk Enterprise system requirements](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Installation/Systemrequirements) apply.

#### Download

Download the SA-dnslookup at [GitHub](https://github.com/seunomosowon/SA-geodistance).

#### Installation steps

To install and configure this app on your supported standalone platform, do one of the following:

- Install on a standalone search head via the GUI (https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/Overview/Singleserverinstall)
- Extract the app to ```$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/``` and restart Splunk

For a supported distributed environment, follow the steps to install the SA-geodistance on the search head only.

## USER GUIDE

### Key concepts for SA-dnslookup

<code>
<base_search> dnslookup (recordtype=<string>) (input_field=<string>) | (output_field=<string>) | 
                  (search_suffix=<string>)? | (server=<string>)*
</code>

This app looks up the value of the field passed in `input_field`, and saves the response to `output_field`
using either the system resolver or any custom resolver passed as a list of servers.
This command can also take a list of search_suffixes to be used to search for hostnames.

Record types requested can include any of the DNS record types or FORWARD / REVERSE which corresponds to 
A and PTR respectively

#### Example

```
| makeresults 
| eval _raw = "www.google.com,4.2.2.2", shost="encrypted"
| rex "^(?<h>[\w\.\-]+),(?<ip>.*)$"
| dnslookup recordtype="FORWARD" input_field=h output_field="dst_ip"  search_suffix="google.com,yahoo.com" server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4
| dnslookup recordtype="ptr" input_field=ip output_field="dest_host"  search_suffix="google.com,yahoo.com"
| dnslookup recordtype="AAAA" input_field=shost output_field="dst_ip6"  search_suffix="google.com"
```

Scenario 1:
``` 
| dnslookup recordtype="FORWARD" input_field=h output_field="dst_ip"  search_suffix="google.com,yahoo.com" server=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 
```

This tries to resolve the name www.google.com using the custom dns servers provided. It resolves the names without the suffices 
since the name is a fully qualified domain name. The output is stored in dst_ip.

Scenario 2:
``` 
| dnslookup recordtype="ptr" input_field=ip output_field="dest_host"  search_suffix="google.com,yahoo.com"
```

This tries to resolve the IP: 4.2.2.2 to the dest_host.  

Scenario 3:
``` 
| dnslookup recordtype="AAAA" input_field=shost output_field="dst_ip6"  search_suffix="google.com"
```

This command resolves the the relative name "encrypted" using the DNS suffix "google.com" into the IPv6 address.
and writes the output to dst_ip6.


### Data types

This app outputs the DNS resolution result to the output_field parameter.


### Configure SA-dnslookup

This app has no configurations.


### Upgrade SA-geodistance
